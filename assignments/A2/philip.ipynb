    ">\n",
    "> If you re-use a substantial portion of code you find online, e.g on Stackoverflow, you need to add a link to it and make the borrowing explicit. The same applies of you take it and modify it, even substantially. There is nothing bad in doing that, providing you are acknowledging it and make it clear you know what you're doing.\n",

    "> Make sure your notebooks have been run when you sumit, as I won't run them myself. Submit both the `.ipynb` file along with an `.html` export of the same. Submit all necessary auxilliary files as well. Please compress your submission into a `.zip` archive. Only `.zip` files can be submitted."

    "> As follows:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * 70 points for correctly completing the assignment.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * 20 points for appropriately writing and organizing your code in terms of structure, readibility (also by humans), comments and minimal documentation. It is important to be concise but also to explain what you did and why, when not obvious.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * 10 points for doing something extra, e.g., if you go beyond expectations (overall or on something specific). Some ideas for extras might be mentioned in the exercises, or you can come up with your own. You don't need to do them all to get the bonus. The sum of points is 90, doing (some of) the extras can bring you to 100, so the extras are not necessary to get an A.\n",

Evaluate all of your models on the dataset in `data/SimLex-999.txt`, and determine the best performing model. Note: There should be 5 to 8 model evaluations in total. 5 if you did not do any extra (2 from 4.1 + 2 from 4.2 + 1 from 4.3), and 8 if you did them all (3 from 4.1 + 3 from 4.2 + 2 from 4.3).\n",
